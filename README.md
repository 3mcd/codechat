A collaborative chat application with a real time code interface built with Derby JS and SUIT CSS components.

Install into your Derby project. You also need to install bower to install the SUITCSS dependencies. From the root derby project directory:

```
cd public/

npm install bower
```

and then:

```
bower install --save suit

bower install --save suit-grid-layouts
```
